# Pok√©mon Crater Remake
This project was created with the intent to learn React and GraphQL and to recreate a game that made part of my childhood: Pokemon Crater.

It is made with GraphQL v(i will remember and update here, since this project had been untouched for 3 years).

There are some improvements in mind, such as adding unit tests, e2e tests, some sort of mocking server for local development purposes, good credential management, component refactoring (because most of whats developed was made by my inexperienced mind several years ago).


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the server in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in the browser.
